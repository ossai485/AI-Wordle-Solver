    "\n",
    "* **A* ({heuristic_name}) Performance:** This heuristic {'prioritizes information gain' if 'entropy' in heuristic_name.lower() else 'optimizes search space reduction'}, leading to {'excellent' if astar_failure_rate < 5 else 'good'} accuracy with a **{astar_failure_rate:.2f}% failure rate**.\n",

    "* **CBP (Fixed Frequency) Performance:** Uses simpler frequency-based scoring, achieving a **{cbp_failure_rate:.2f}% failure rate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficiency Statement:** {efficiency_statement}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Trade-off:** The A* solver with {heuristic_name} heuristic completed in **{astar_total_time:.2f}s** compared to CBP's **{cbp_total_time:.2f}s**, representing a **{abs(speedup-1)*100:.1f}%** {'speedup' if speedup < 1 else 'slowdown'}.\n",

    "**Conclusion:** The {heuristic_name} heuristic demonstrates {'excellent balance between speed and accuracy' if 'hybrid' in heuristic_name.lower() else 'strong performance characteristics'}, making it {'the optimal choice' if astar_avg_guesses < cbp_avg_guesses and speedup > 0.5 else 'a competitive option'} for Wordle solving.\n",
